1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,190
We were abandoned.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,480
That's why we live in a camp
surrounded by walls.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,570
Because the blood of devils
runs through us.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,740
That's also why your father isn't here.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,370
Your father... is Marleyan.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,460
He can't be with us Eldians.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,710
If only we were Marleyan...

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,470
Oh, yeah...

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,690
Back then, I strove to be a Warrior
so we could be Marleyans.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,110
Who said you could walk?!
Run, you filthy seed of swine!

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,320
Don't you wanna be Honorary Marleyans?!

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,120
Did you guys hear? We're attacking
Paradis Island in just a few years.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,210
Huh?

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,710
It's almost time for us to inherit Titans!

15
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,260
Out of the seven of us, they're picking six!

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,840
Yes! I can finally be Marleyan!

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,520
Huh? Why so excited?
If anyone's the worst, it's you.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,180
Excuse me?!

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,190
What's your strong point?

20
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,100
Huh?

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,440
Your strength? Your brains?
Your aim? Combat ability?

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,370
Nope. The only value they see in you
is your loyalty to Marley.

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,080
"I'll slaughter the island devils
real good for you, sir!"

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,000
You making fun of our mission?!
Or maybe you're a stray Restorationist?!

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,880
Huh?!

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,260
You are, aren't you?!
I'll report you to the commander!

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,380
Report this, you little shit!

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,720
Want some more?!

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,010
Porco, enough!

30
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,260
Hating the island doesn't make you special!

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,640
Have fun waiting 13 years alone!

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,980
--Tsk!
--Porco!

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,730
Let's go, Pieck.

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,450
Don't cry too long or the
commander will chew me out.

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,530
Reiner, I'm sorry.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,790
Stand up, Reiner.

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,120
C'mon.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,090
I'm gonna become a Marleyan
and live with my mom and dad.

39
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,130
I can't wait 13 years.

40
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,470
But it's like he said. I'm the worst.

41
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,180
Porco doesn't make the decision.
Besides, loyalty is important.

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,560
Right, Annie?

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,900
Huh? What? I wasn't listening.

44
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,450
You really want that as your goal?

45
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,410
Huh?

46
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,330
Thirteen years is all you get.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,120
Thirteen years to be a hero.

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,710
If I crush the devils on Paradis,
I'll save the world.

49
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,340
Then my parents will be proud
to have me as a son.

50
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,770
I wish something would happen.

51
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,310
Eren! There you are!

52
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,030
"The Door of Hope"

53
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,160
Marvelous. Even better than we expected.

54
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,840
The Female Titan.
Versatility is its biggest strength.

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,300
On top of its mobility and endurance,
its hardened strikes are incredibly destructive.

56
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,060
The range is limited,
but it can call Pure Titans, too.

57
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,680
Leonhart is perfect.

58
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,270
The Armored Titan specializes in hardening.

59
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,230
If it charges in at full speed,
the gates of any wall will crumble.

60
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,990
As Marley's shield that must withstand attacks,
it suits Braun's perseverance.

61
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,330
The Jaw Titan is an assault weapon.

62
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,040
It's as speedy as it is small, with claws
and jaw that crush nearly everything.

63
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,340
Entrusted to the quick-witted Marcel.

64
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,590
The Beast Titan is as potent as ever.

65
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,970
Though slightly larger than the other Titans,

66
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,140
its throwing technique is dreadful
on another level.

67
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,520
What's more, his blood
seems to have hidden power.

68
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,360
The Cart Titan has outstanding endurance,
suitable for long missions.

69
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,910
It can be outfitted with different
equipment to extend its usefulness.

70
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,960
Pieck's superior judgment will serve well.

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,290
And then, there's the Colossal Titan...

72
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,050
A god of destruction.

73
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,020
Hoover will be able to handle it.

74
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,230
I feel bad for those island devils.

75
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,270
One day, that's gonna show up to kill 'em.

76
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,320
This new Warrior unit may
outperform their predecessors,

77
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,570
but I question the military's decision.

78
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,540
Sending children to retake the
Founding Titan sounds insane to me.

79
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:23,290
You think? Didn't those children
just crush a nation before our eyes?

80
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,210
It's messed up! Why was
the worst of us chosen?!

81
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,590
What did you do?!

82
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,760
Seems you're the worst.
That's all there is to it, Pock.

83
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,430
You little--!

84
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,060
Porco! You sure you wanna defy the brass?!

85
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,350
Huh?

86
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,150
Reiner... I'm sorry.

87
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,650
Huh?

88
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,960
Dad!

89
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,090
It's you, right? Mom used to work in
these barracks before I was born!

90
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,550
That's where you met her! Karina Braun!

91
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,390
Look at this! Mom and I are
Honorary Marleyans! We can all live--

92
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,180
Bloody hell!

93
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,020
Did that woman send you here?!
To get revenge on me?! Shit!

94
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,060
Now her kid's a Warrior?!

95
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,570
If they find out where you're from,
my family is screwed!

96
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,490
You're gonna get me hanged!
I'm running the hell away!

97
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,870
Away from you and your damn Eldian mother!

98
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,620
Reiner!

99
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,660
Reiner!

100
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,120
I'll be waiting for you!

101
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,590
That's right. Even without a father,

102
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm still the chosen Warrior
of the Armored Titan.

103
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,220
I'll save everyone from the island devils
and be the world's hero.

104
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,230
We didn't cover much ground tonight.

105
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,980
Can't do much about the clouds.

106
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,410
Will the King really not use the Founding
Titan, even if we break the wall?

107
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,330
What's the use asking now?
Trust Marley's research.

108
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,790
That's right. We can't turn back.

109
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,460
Tomorrow, we reach the wall... and then...

110
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,720
Huh? What? Are you having second
thoughts about killing the devils?

111
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
Have you forgotten what they've done?

112
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,310
We're the world's chosen Warriors
sent to punish the island devils!

113
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,230
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,190
Huh?

115
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,450
Reiner, I'm sorry. You were never meant
to be chosen as a Warrior.

116
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:03,990
I talked you up and criticized
my brother to influence their decision.

117
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,200
Huh?

118
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,710
I... just wanted to protect my brother.

119
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm sorry, Reiner... I'm sorry!

120
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,220
Why... are you apologizing?

121
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,170
Bertholdt...! Annie...! Marcel...!

122
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,630
They got eaten!
They got eaten because of me!

123
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,010
And I'll be next!

124
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,890
This is where I'm gonna die!

125
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,470
Not bad.

126
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,810
This is a first. You actually beat me...
in a long-distance... race...

127
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,650
Huh?

128
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:20,490
If we... took out that Titan...
we wouldn't have... lost Jaw...

129
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,660
Shit! Now Marcel's gone for good.

130
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,200
They said there wouldn't be Titans this far out!

131
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,790
We've gotta go home.

132
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,660
Huh?

133
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,670
Let's find Jaw and leave.
They would've changed back to human.

134
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,670
Besides, without Marcel to lead,
this mission is doomed.

135
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,180
Wait...

136
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,510
We can't...

137
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,810
We can't!

138
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,440
We can't go home!
We've gotta continue the mission!

139
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,320
Oh, yeah... If we go back now,
you'll just get eaten by the next Warrior.

140
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,820
Not that I give a shit.

141
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,700
You think only I will?

142
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,410
Huh?

143
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,370
That only I'll get the blame for running away?

144
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,620
You guys are that certain
you won't get eaten, too?

145
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,960
Catching Jaw won't be easy either.

146
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,300
If they used its power and ran,
our Titans could never catch up.

147
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,470
They can't control it right after becoming--

148
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,390
You controlled the Colossal Titan, no problem!

149
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,930
Anyways, we're doomed at this rate!

150
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,230
Without the Founding Titan,
there's no going home!

151
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,110
Back there, if you were a fraction
as calm as you are now,

152
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,610
we wouldn't have lost Marcel or Jaw.

153
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,370
But you've got no problem intimidating
us to save your own ass, huh?!

154
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,120
How about you come clean to Magath?!
Tell him, "It's all my fault!"

155
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,500
Honorary Marleyan, my ass!
Chosen Warrior, my ass!

156
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,760
Marleyans, Eldians! They're all liars!
Everyone only thinks about themselves!

157
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,220
I'm no different! I've gotta get home alive!

158
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,600
If you feel guilty, just die!
Take all the blame and die!

159
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,410
Reiner is dead.

160
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,200
If we need Marcel, then I'll be Marcel.

161
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,250
Please, stop this...

162
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,790
This is the only way we'll be able
to go back home!

163
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,380
Let's go back... together... to our hometown!

164
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,740
Huh?

165
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,500
I wanted to be a Warrior.

166
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,040
I thought I could make my mom's wish
come true and we'd live with my father.

167
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,710
But... I had a father who
didn't want any part of us.

168
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,090
My mom had a dream she knew
would never come true.

169
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,970
I should never have been chosen.
I should have died today.

170
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,850
Why'd he apologize?
Why'd he save someone like me?

171
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,610
No! I'm not ready for this to end!

172
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,030
I still don't understand anything!

173
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,330
Where is this?

174
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,580
Inside Wall Rose.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,540
Annie... Bertholdt...

176
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,420
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,510
Marcel... I'll be the Warrior I should've been.

178
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,970
You! What the hell did you come here for?!

179
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,970
To save humanity!

180
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Warrior Candidates"
"A unit of child soldiers consisting of Eldian 'devils.' Under command of the Marley army, they undergo harsh training and are selected based on their grades, skills, behavior, personality, and devotion to Marley.

181
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,980
As only Eldian 'devils' can inherit the Nine Titans,
the existence of Eldians is crucial for the
defense of Marley. As such, Eldians selected to become Warriors are granted 'Honorary Marleyan' status along with their immediate family."

182
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,690
I lived in Wall Maria,
deep in the southeast mountains.

183
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,900
It happened at dawn.

184
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,120
The animals were all stirred up
and I heard a strange rumbling.

185
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,000
Thinking it was footsteps,
I opened the window...

186
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,290
The rest is a blur,
but I ran away on my horse.

187
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,260
Leaving behind three kids
about the same age as you guys.

188
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,690
Hey, missy. You've got good taste
in men to tail a geezer like me.

189
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,110
I was born at an inn.

190
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,780
My mom, who works there, talks about
my father so much, I know that it's you.

191
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,290
Well, that's real touching. If you want
a hug from papa, put your hands up.

192
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,790
How are you sure it's not you?

193
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,590
I made a promise to my sister.
This joke of yours ain't making me laugh.

194
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,130
You're so mean, papa!

195
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,810
Hey now... Having a rebellious phase, are we?

196
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,020
That's a new one.

197
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,520
Are his legs saying snow today?

198
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,780
Nah. That's the clear skies position.

199
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,530
Call it hail or you'll be late for muster.

200
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,070
Wake up, Bertholdt!

201
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,040
While you two snoozed
after playing with your friends,

202
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,210
I was busy crawling around
the capital's sewers.

203
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,840
I've hit my limit if he's around.

204
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,000
Your limit, huh?

205
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,090
Let's take what we know back to Marley.
They'll be happy to hear anything.

206
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,510
Do you honestly think that?

207
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,310
Not if it's all we have to show
after five years.

208
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,140
Then, what are you saying we do?!

209
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,270
Destroy Wall Rose.

210
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,570
It's the only way we can
smoke out the Founding Titan.

211
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,320
A lot of your friends are gonna die.

212
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,990
I keep telling you:
They're not friends--they're devils.

213
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,080
But gaining their trust can't hurt.
And frankly, your aloof behavior isn't--

214
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm gonna barf. Can you move
your face away from mine?

215
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,510
I bet you're exhausted.
Sorry for always laying the burden on you.

216
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,720
Let's call it a day.

217
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,140
I keep having the same dream.

218
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,940
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

219
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:17,490
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

220
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,960
Eren, take a break. You're gonna die.

221
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,000
Shit!

222
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,300
Reiner... How do you do it?

223
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,510
How can I get like you and Mikasa?

224
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,390
At this rate, I'll die without
doing a damn thing!

225
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,690
Just do what you've gotta do.

226
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,020
Keep moving forward.

227
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,990
That's all we can do.

228
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,200
Yeah. You're right.

229
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,120
Aren't you gonna drive out every last Titan?

230
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,200
I know you can do it.

231
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,810
Shit! I can't let this go on!

232
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,610
That's right... I still have those guys...

233
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,290
The hospital...

234
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,750
Hey!

235
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,340
Um, I guess you're recovering well.
You're good enough to talk now.

236
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,100
Kinda. I'm here for
emotional trauma, but it's a lie.

237
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,890
Huh?

238
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,270
I said I lost my memory and can't
go home, but I just don't want to.

239
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,570
It'd be hard to face my family now.

240
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,320
Will you snitch on me?

241
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,400
I wouldn't do that.

242
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,530
You're hurt. Is it from your Warrior training?

243
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,250
Yeah, but I won't become one.

244
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,460
Another candidate is so talented,
I don't even stand a chance.

245
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,170
That's good to hear.

246
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,000
Huh?

247
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,840
You're a good guy. I hope you live a long life.

248
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,970
But I don't want them to be a Warrior.

249
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,520
Why not?

250
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,810
Is the other candidate a girl?

251
00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:00,780
She's famous around here.
She did incredible things in the war.

252
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,030
Everyone's saying she should
be the next Armor.

253
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,910
But since I'm powerless,
I can't do a damn thing about it.

254
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:20,590
Every day I'm here, I think:
Why did it ever come to this?

255
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,340
Damaged minds and bodies...
Their freedom taken away...

256
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,100
Even losing themselves.

257
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,680
If people knew it would come to this,
nobody would go to war.

258
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,860
But most people are pushed by something,
forced to march into hell.

259
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:47,320
That "something" wasn't their choice.
Their situation or others made them do it.

260
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,160
But people who push their own backs
see a different kind of hell.

261
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,920
They can see something beyond the hell.

262
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,300
It might be hope.
It may even be another hell.

263
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,550
Only those who keep moving
forward will ever know.

264
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:46,280
Magath sorts out the military
for the Tybur family to tell the truth.

265
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:52,170
As the festival enlivens the city,
an unexpected surprise awaits Reiner.

266
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,540
Next episode: "From One Hand to Another."

267

"From One Hand to Another"
